# App-Development-with-Python
Everything about creating multi-platform apps using the Python language
The main Python libaries used are Kivy and KivyMD (the material design version of Kivy).
You can find many project folders you can check and there are also PDF books to guide you on how to build apps with Python.

## [Books and Documentations](https://github.com/Samuel-HSSP/App-Development-with-Python/tree/main/Books%20and%20Documentations)
This repository contains PDF books and documentations that would help you write efficient code for building apps using Python.

## [Calculator](https://github.com/Samuel-HSSP/App-Development-with-Python/tree/main/Calculator)
A Complex Calculator app made with Python. Python is not a common programming language for building calculator apps because of the few functionalities the eval() function, math and cmath modules offer. However, this unfinished calculator project will make almost all the functions on a scientific calculator available on the app. You can type expressions as you would type in a normal calculator and it returns swift answers.
Because Python would not be a great choice for the backend, I have decided to use a JavaScript library called [MathJS](https://mathjs.org/). It offers all the functions needed to parse expressions without errors. In the future, there might be a Python version of MathJS, so Python also offers everything needed.
