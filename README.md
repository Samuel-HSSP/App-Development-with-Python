# App-Development-with-Python
Everything about creating multi-platform apps using the Python language
The main Python libaries used are Kivy and KivyMD (the material design version of Kivy).
You can find many project folders you can check and there are also PDF books to guide you on how to build apps with Python.

## [Books and Documentations](https://github.com/Samuel-HSSP/App-Development-with-Python/tree/main/Books%20and%20Documentations)
This repository contains PDF books and documentations that would help you write efficient code for building apps using Python.

## [Calculator](https://github.com/Samuel-HSSP/App-Development-with-Python/tree/main/Calculator)
A Complex Calculator app made with Python. Python is not a common programming language for building calculator apps because of the few functionalities the eval() function, math and cmath modules offer. However, this unfinished calculator project will make almost all the functions on a scientific calculator available on the app. You can type expressions as you would type in a normal calculator and it returns swift answers.
Because Python would not be a great choice for the backend, I have decided to use a JavaScript library called [MathJS](https://mathjs.org/). It offers all the functions needed to parse expressions without errors. In the future, there might be a Python version of MathJS, so Python also offers everything needed.

## [Morse Code Translator](https://github.com/Samuel-HSSP/App-Development-with-Python/tree/main/Morse%20Code%20Translator)
After identifying a major problems with Morse code translators, I built this app to tackle the issues. The first problem was that most Morse code translators will only allow you to translate from English characters to Morse code, and not vice versa. My version of a Morse code translator allows you to do both.
Furthermore, you can now play the Morse codes character by character, according to what you translated. It has the audio files for all the alphabets, and I built a complex algorithms to concatenate these audio files, depending on the characters in the output. For example, if the word is "Morse", it would play the morse code sound for "M", "O", "R", "S" and "E" in that order.

## [WhatsApp Status Saver](https://github.com/Samuel-HSSP/App-Development-with-Python/tree/main/WhatsApp%20Status%20Saver)
WhatsApp status savers look cool, but they are actually what you can build yourself. This WhatsApp status saver is completely built in Python and it allows you to save your photos and videos from WhatsApp on your device. I also wrote an article explaining how I built this app, please find it [here](https://samuelhssp.hashnode.dev/whatsapp-status-saver-app-with-python).

## [Translator](https://github.com/Samuel-HSSP/App-Development-with-Python/tree/main/Translator)
As you may have guessed, this is a pure translator app for translating words between several languages. It also supports inputting text from your microphone and speaking the translated message in the desired language.
